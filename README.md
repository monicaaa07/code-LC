Leet Code Problems - Solved

# Description
This Project has some questions of Leet Code  
It contains only code snippets. Cannot be executed on local after cloning.    

The code snippets committed are as follows:  

1) twoSum.py :    
* Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.  
Example 1:  
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
